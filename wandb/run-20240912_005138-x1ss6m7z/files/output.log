Some weights of BertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-l and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight', 'pooler.dense.bias', 'pooler.dense.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
wandb: WARNING The `run_name` is currently set to the same value as `TrainingArguments.output_dir`. If this was not intended, please specify a different run name by setting the `TrainingArguments.run_name` parameter.
